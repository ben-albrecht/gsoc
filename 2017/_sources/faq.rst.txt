Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

* I am interested in Chapel as a Google Summer of Code student, where do I
  start?

  * See the :ref:`gsoc-apply` section. It should point you to all the places you
    need to go for getting started.

* When are peak hours for the IRC channel, #chapel-developers?

  * The core Chapel developers are primarily located in the US, so your
    chances of finding a developer on the channel are highest during weekday
    work hours of Pacific through Eastern timezones.
    This is approximately 06:00 - 18:00 Pacific Time.

* I want to start working on the compiler! Where do I start?

  * Slow down young grasshopper. Before you run, you must first learn to walk.
    First, see the `Learning Chapel`_ page. As you learn the language, you can
    start looking for ways to contribute on the :ref:`gsoc-contributing` page

* I've read the documentation on `platform support`_ and can't find Windows
  anywhere.


  * At this stage in Chapel's development, Windows is not *officially*
    supported natively.
    Chapel does appear to be working with the recently added Windows bash
    support. However, this is not thoroughly tested.
    Windows users also have the option of using Cygwin or a VM
    of their favorite linux distribution.
    If you are Windows enthusiast interested in changing this, you might
    be interested in submitting a project proposal for improving Windows support.

* How many students will Chapel be accepting this summer?

  * The number of students we are able to accept is not yet known at this point.
    For reference, Chapel accepted 2 students for GSoC 2016.

* Which projects are highest priority?

  * All projects are considered roughly at the same level of priority. Project
    priority will not be a factor in the proposal evaluation process. Students
    will not be at a disadvantage for proposing a project that is not listed on
    the :ref:`gsoc-ideas`, but they *should* discuss the idea with developers
    before pursuing it as their project proposal.

* What factors should be taken into consideration when choosing projects?

  * Some projects receive higher interest from students than others,
    meaning there may be greater competition for some projects over others.
    You can get an idea of the interest for a given project by browsing the
    mailing list, hanging out in the IRC channel, or just asking one of the
    mentors.

  * No mentor will be able to take more than one student. This may affect the
    projects we are able to accept.

  * With these previous caveats in mind, the primary motivating factor in
    deciding what you work on should be your interest in the project.

* Where can I learn more about previous Chapel Summers of Code?
