<p>These are the steps for applying to Chapel for Google Summer of Code 2017.
It is expected that students complete these steps in the order they are listed.
For example, contacting prospective mentors after familiarizing yourself with the
language and projects that interest you, will leave a good impression with
mentors.</p>
<div class="section" id="familiarize-yourself-with-chapel">
<h2>1. Familiarize yourself with Chapel<a class="headerlink" href="#familiarize-yourself-with-chapel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Familiarize yourself with the project. <a class="reference external" href="http://chapel-lang.org/download.html">Download</a> Chapel,
follow a <a class="reference external" href="http://chapel-lang.org/tutorials.html">tutorial</a>, write a few programs, and <a class="reference external" href="http://chapel-lang.org/learning.html">learn</a> more about the
language. Become familiar with the project’s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/master/doc/rst/developer/bestPractices/ContributorInfo.rst">contributor guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Find a task that excites you<a class="headerlink" href="#find-a-task-that-excites-you" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since you’ll be working on this task as a full-time summer job, it needs
to be something you care about. The <a class="reference internal" href="ideas.html#gsoc-ideas"><span class="std std-ref">Project List</span></a> page provides some project
ideas that have been proposed by this year’s mentors, but you are also welcome
to propose your own project idea.</p>
<p>Work with prospective mentors on the <a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/chapel/mailman/chapel-gsoc/">chapel-gsoc</a> mailing list and Chapel irc
channels in order to understand the technical aspects of a potential project
and to figure out an approach.  You’ll learn more about what the
project entails, and we will learn more about how you approach technical
topics.</p>

Browsing open and closed <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=">GitHub pull requests</a> and the developer
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/master/doc/rst/developer/bestPractices/ContributorInfo.rst">contributor guidelines</a> is a great
way to see how Chapel development proceeds. Show us that you are willing and
able to contribute to the project. See <a class="reference internal" href="contributing.html#gsoc-contributing"><span class="std std-ref">Contributing</span></a> to find
entry-level tasks to work on while getting started. You may also begin
preliminary work for your project as a way to demonstrate your technical
aptitude for that particular project.</p>
