Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

* I am interested in Chapel as a Google Summer of Code student, where do I
  start?

  * See the :ref:`gsoc-apply` section. It should point you to all the places you
    need to go for getting started.

* When are peak hours for the IRC channel, #chapel-developers?

  * The core Chapel developers are primarily located in the US, so your
    chances of finding a developer on the channel are highest during weekday
    work hours of Pacific through Eastern timezones.
    This is approximately 06:00 - 18:00 Pacific Time.

* I want to start working on the compiler! Where do I start?

  * Slow down young grasshopper. Before you run, you must first learn to walk.
    First, see the `Learning Chapel`_ page. As you learn the language, you can
    start looking for ways to contribute on the :ref:`gsoc-contributing` page

* I've read the documentation on `platform support`_ and can't find Windows anywhere.

  * At this stage in Chapel's development, Windows is not supported natively.
    If you are Windows enthusiast interested in changing this, the **Improve
    Windows support in Chapel** :ref:`gsoc-compatibility` project may be for
    you.  Windows users can still use Chapel through Cygwin or a VM of their
    favorite linux distribution.

* How many students will Chapel be accepting this summer?

  * The number of students we are able to accept is not yet known at this point.
    As a first year organization, we expect to take no more than half the
    number of mentors.

* Which projects are highest priority?

  * All projects are roughly at the same level of priority. Project priority
    will not be a factor in the proposal evaluation process. Students will not
    be at a disadvantage for proposing a project that is not listed on the
    :ref:`gsoc-ideas`, but they *should* discuss the idea with developers before
    pursuing it as their project proposal.

* What factors should be taken into consideration when choosing projects?

    * Some projects receive higher interest from students than others,
      meaning there may be greater competition for some projects over others.
      You can get an idea of the interest for given project by browsing the
      mailing list, hanging out in the IRC channel, or just asking one of the
      mentors.

    * No mentor will be able to take more than one student. This may affect the
      projects we are able to accept.

    * With these previous caveats in mind, the primary motivating factor in
      deciding what you work on should be your interest in the project.
