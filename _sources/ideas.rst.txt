Libraries and Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Iterator Library
----------------

:Description:
  The Chapel language supports both serial and parallel iterators. It would be
  useful to provide a toolkit of common serial and parallel iterators to users
  through a library. Python’s `itertools library`_ would make a good
  reference for target functionality as well as performance comparisons.

:Expected Results:
  An iterator library that implements some subset of Python’s itertools library
  in Chapel. This project could take a breadth-first approach or depth-first
  approach, where depth would involve optimizing performance and implementing
  parallel iterators. The stretch goal is to document and propose design
  solutions to constraints in Chapel iterators.

:Skills Required:
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language
  - Experience with another language that supports iterators

:Difficulty: 1/7

:Mentor(s): `Ben Albrecht`_, `Krishna Kumar Dey`_

Utility Modules
---------------

:Description:
  Develop some utility modules missing from Chapel’s standard library:

  1. Environment variable interface module

    - Implement an interface for reading, writing, and searching environment
      variables.
    - Chapel’s environment variable interface should be locale-aware.
    - There is some discussion in the `Env module issue`_.

  2. Shell lexer module

    - Implement a simple lexer that support shell-style quoting, commenting,
      and escaping.
    - There is some discussion in the `Shlex module issue`_.

:Expected Results:
  An *Env* module and *Shlex* module contributed to the Chapel repository,
  including design review.

:Skills Required:
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language

Container for Different Data Structures in Chapel
-------------------------------------------------

:Description:
  Chapel Language currently supports a lot of data structures as standard
  modules and packages such as `List`_, `Set`_, `Map`_ `LinkedList`_,
  `Bag`_, `Stack`_, `Queue`_, and `Deque`_.  This project aims to add more data
  structures to this list.

:Expected Result:
  Implement several sequential data structures, including:

      - Unrolled Linked List
      - Search Tree
      - Skip List
      - Interval/Range Tree

  Publish these data structures as mason packages

:Skills Required:
  Good grasp over data structures, proficient in some programming language and
  able to learn Chapel.

I/O Performance
---------------

:Description:
  Investigate performance of I/O routines in Chapel, and make improvements. The
  Chapel language includes an I/O system in its standard library. While this I/O
  system is flexible and capable, to date, little work has been done to analyze
  its performance and recommend usage. In addition, it is missing some features
  that would work well with Chapel’s support for parallel computing - in
  particular a way to read all of the lines in a file in parallel (see the
  `parallel file.lines() issue`_).

:Expected Results:
  This project will begin by studying I/O performance in Chapel. Work will
  involve writing test programs to measure performance and comparing performance
  to other languages (such as C and Python).

  A second phase of the project will add to and improve the implementation of the
  I/O routines with performance in mind. This will include implementing the
  parallel file.lines() feature described above and also address shortcomings
  identified in the first phase.

  The final phase of the project will be to write a user-facing guide to writing
  performant I/O code in Chapel.

:Skills Required:
  - Proficient in C or C++
  - Experience with I/O operations such as fread, read, and mmap in C
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language

Distributed Online Storage for Serialized Data
----------------------------------------------

:Description:
  The Chapel language has excellent support for distributing and accessing large
  amounts of data over many locales, including arrays of strings and custom
  objects.  A program/library that can accept and return serialized data from
  either external or internal programs would be useful for applications that must
  pass around substantial quantities of data with no specified type. Redis and
  KeyDB are examples of prior work in this area.

:Expected Results:
  A library (or optionally, program) that can store data in a distributed array,
  preferably data that has been serialized with a commonly used accessible scheme
  such as protocol buffers.  The library could be used in other Chapel programs
  to lower the barrier to entry to writing distributed Chapel code, whereas the
  program approach could leverage the library and use a protocol such as ZMQ to
  store/distribute/retrieve data on demand.

:Skills Required:
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language
  - Will need to become somewhat familiar with serialization schemes.
  - Stretch goal would require understanding of ZMQ and inter-process
    communication.

Libraries for Web Services
--------------------------

:Description:

  Since many modern applications involve web services, we would like to be able
  to write some web services in Chapel. Therefore this project is to create a
  library to support writing web services in Chapel. This will allow Chapel to
  fit into more use cases and also enable tools such as a web-based execution
  monitor. While the focus of this project will be on building a library that
  allows Chapel programs implement web services, it will also involve creating
  libraries to create a web server in Chapel and libraries to support socket
  programming in Chapel.

:Expected Results:

  An implementation of a library enabling REST web services to be written in
  Chapel and that supports communication with JavaScript programs using
  WebSockets. Since programs using WebSockets have the ability to communicate
  any data in a streaming manner, the WebSockets support will involve creating
  a sockets support library. The sockets support library should be designed in
  a manner that allows for concurrency and parallelism. Logging,
  authentication, https support, and error handling are additional features to
  consider.

:Skills Required:
  - Familiarity with a few web services libraries in other languages
  - Experience using web services and WebSockets from JavaScript
  - Experience with sockets in some language
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language

Physics Simulation/MD Engine in Chapel
--------------------------------------

:Description:

  While there are a few Molecular Dynamics engines that are scalable (such as
  LAMMPS), they tend to be written in C++ and make use of scaling technologies
  like MPI.  This increases the barrier to entry to contributing to
  computational physics/biophysics code/methods.  Alternatively, an engine
  written in Chapel would massively reduce the overhead required to scale,
  allowing large scale (or an ensemble of) simulations written in code that is
  easier to understand and modify.  In addition, the use of Chapel’s
  distributed data structures would allow for running simulations at scales
  heretofore unheard of.

:Expected Results:

  A Chapel program that is able to take a system of point particles and apply
  an energy function to calculate how the system moves in time.  This would be
  solid foundational work, and a stretch goal would be writing the code
  necessary to run a system too large to fit on one compute node.

:Skills Required:
  - Strong foundation in Newtonian physics and mathematics at the calculus level.
  - Desire to learn how numerical simulations are performed.
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language

:Difficulty: 5/7

Distributed Linear Algebra
--------------------------

:Description:

  The Chapel programming language’s Linear Algebra library primarily relies on
  LAPACK and BLAS, which adds an additional dependency and only works on
  shared-memory matrices and vectors. This project aims to provide a native
  shared-memory and distributed Chapel implementation for the Linear Algebra
  operations available in the LinearAlgebra package. The effort will include
  both sparse and dense versions of core linear algebra operations.

:Expected Results:

  Contribution of shared-memory and distributed linear algebra operations. A
  naive implementation of dense linear algebra is the minimum required, with
  optimizations to avoid redundant and unnecessary communications as a target
  goal, along with benchmarks to measure the performance of said
  implementation.

:Skills required:
  - Strong linear algebra background (to lead discussion)
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language

Parser
~~~~~~

A Better Parser
---------------

:Description:
  Implement an improved parser for the Chapel language. An improved parser can:
  Provide better error messages instead of “syntax error”
  Provide parse trees to tools besides the Chapel compiler
  Support parsing in more interactive settings such as code completion in editor or in an interpreter

  Note that the Chapel compiler currently has a lex/bison parser with included
  actions that are relevant only to the current Chapel compiler. See also
  the `Language Server`_, `Linter`_, and `lint flag`_ issues as well as
  `antlr.org`_.

:Expected Results:

  A new parser for the Chapel programming language written in ANTLR or another
  agreed-upon parsing strategy. Work on the parser will be done incrementally
  by developing rules to parse more and more complex example programs. By the
  end of the project, the parser should be able to parse all of the Chapel test
  suite source code that compiles today. A stretch goal would be to use the
  parser to create a linter or code completion tool for Chapel.

:Skills Required:
  - Experience with compilers, in particular knowledge of context-free grammars.
  - Proficient in C++
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language

Language Interoperability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Call Python code from Chapel
----------------------------

:Description:
  Currently, it is possible to compile Chapel programs as Python libraries to
  leverage the power of Chapel within a scripted language.  However,
  multiprocessing becomes more difficult in this paradigm, and the control of
  program execution rests in Python.  Alternatively, Python code could be
  called from Chapel, allowing the program to be more scriptable while allowing
  Chapel to do all the heavy lifting regarding data distribution and
  multiprocessing.  Some initial work has been done on embedding the Python
  interpreter, showing this as feasible.

:Expected Results:
  A library that allows for calling Python code/functions and using the
  returned values within Chapel.  As a stretch goal, it would be nice to write
  a companion Python lib (in C) that can reach back into Chapel, on demand, and
  return data.  In addition, the library would ideally work with arbitrary
  types of structs (as all objects in Python are represented as structs of type
  *PyObject*, or structs which have inherited from said structure (and can be
  used as *PyObjects*)).

:Skills Required:
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language
  - Knowledge of C, or desire to learn.
  - Some desire to read and understand CPython and how modules are written.

C++ Interoperation
------------------

:Description:
  Chapel already has support for interoperation between Chapel and C, Python,
  and Fortran. This project will investigate interoperation between Chapel and
  C++.

  Interoperation between Chapel and C++ will build upon existing work for
  interoperation between Chapel and C. This work enables extern blocks - in
  which C code can be embedded within a Chapel program - and makes use of the
  clang compiler.

:Expected Results:
  The student will need to develop solutions to interoperability challenges
  with C++. Here is a list of C++ features that will require specific
  attention:

      - name mangling
      - method calls
      - RAII / local variable destruction
      - function overloading
      - function templates

  The expected result is that C++ functions and methods will be callable on C++
  types that are available within Chapel, and that the destructor for local
  variables of C++ type will be called at the appropriate time. Supporting C++
  templates over Chapel types and operator overloading are stretch goals.


:Skills Required:
  - Experience with clang internals and implementation
  - In-depth knowledge C++
  - Will need to know or learn Chapel programming language
